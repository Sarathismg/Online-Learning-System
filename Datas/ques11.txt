In 2008, October 9th Shakib led a broken Bangladesh to one of the thumping win over New-Zealand. His allround performance was the key to success in that tournament.
Who took 11 wickets in his first two ODIs?In 2015, Mustafizur made his brilliant debut with 5 wickets haul and 6 wickets haul respectively.His brilliant bowling stunned Indian players. Though after his first match everyone thought that it was an accident that he surprised all the indians , but soon it was found that the trend continues match after match. Everyday he is foxing batsmen with his brilliant techniques and well disguised cutters. He is thought to be the best in that after Wasim akram.
